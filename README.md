# JSONUserAdmin

Strong Points 
1  Simple and easy-to-understand console app for user management: register, login, edit, delete. 
2  Saves user data in JSON format — easy to use and move. 
3  Admin panel to view, search, edit, and delete users. 
4  Checks user input (age, password length) and handles errors. 
5  Password generator for user convenience. 
6  Well-structured code with clear functions. 
7  Uses basic Python features: dictionaries, loops, exceptions, file handling. 
8  Easy to add new features without big changes.

Weak Points
0 Passwords are saved as plain text — not safe for real use.
1 Only one user can be logged in at a time.
2 No strong password rules besides length.
3 Some input checks repeat — code can be shorter and cleaner.
4 No automated tests to check code changes.
5 No protection from many login attempts (brute force).
6 Console interface only — a GUI or web interface would be better.
7 No classes or modular design, which could make code easier to maintain.
